## Overview

This project aims to design a Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) for Crazyflie 2.0, a quadrotor, to enable it to track desired trajectories and visit a set of waypoints. The primary objectives are to ensure robust performance, achieve precise tracking, and minimize control efforts.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to develop a Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) for the Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor to make it follow a pre-defined trajectory even in the presence of external disturbances.

## Solution Approach

### Part 1: Mathematical Model
The equations of motion for the Crazyflie 2.0 are modeled as a set of nonlinear differential equations:
```math

\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)

```
where $`F_{dx}, F_{dy}, F_{dz}`$ are the drag forces and $`F_{th}`$ is the thrust force generated by the motors.

### Part 2: Trajectory Generation

Generated a polynomial trajectory of magnitude 5 for the x, y, and z directions. The drone has to reach specific waypoints in a given time frame, starting from the origin (0,0,0).<br>
The quadrotor's trajectory is planned using quintic polynomial equations:
```math
\[ x_d(t) = a_0 + a_1t + a_2t^2 + a_3t^3 + a_4t^4 + a_5t^5 \]
```
The coefficients \( a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_5 \) are computed to satisfy boundary conditions at waypoints \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_5 \).
### Part 3: Controller Design

Used the given equations of motion to design a boundary layer sliding mode control law. The controller is designed for each of the generalized coordinates (z, φ, θ, ψ) to ensure the drone follows the desired trajectory.<br>

A sliding mode controller is employed to control the Crazyflie 2.0. The sliding surfaces \( S \) are defined as:
```math
\[ S = \dot{e} + \lambda e \]
```
where \( e \) is the tracking error. The control laws \( u \) are designed to ensure that the system state reaches the sliding surfaces in finite time and stays there.
```math
\[ u = -K 	ext{sgn}(S) \]
```
#### Controller for \( z \)
```math
\(
u_1 = m \left( g + \ddot{z}_d + \lambda_1 ( \dot{z}_d - \dot{z} ) + K_1     ext{sat}( S_1 ) 
ight) / ( \cos(\phi) \cos(    heta) )
\)
```
Where \( S_1 = \dot{z}_d - \dot{z} + \lambda_1 ( z_d - z ) \)

#### Controller for \( \phi \)
```math
\(
u_2 = -     ext{(rotational terms)} - \lambda_2 \dot{\phi} I_x - K_2 I_x     ext{sat}( S_2 )
\)
```
Where \( S_2 = \dot{\phi}_d - \dot{\phi} + \lambda_2 ( \phi_d - \phi ) \)

#### Controller for \(theta \) and \( \psi \)

Similar equations were derived for \(theta \) and \( \psi \).

### Part 4: Simulation and Evaluation

Wrote a Python script that uses ROS and Gazebo to simulate the performance of the Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor. The code initializes a ROS node and subscribes to the relevant topics to obtain real-time odometry data.

## Tuning Parameters

Adjusted the tuning parameters for optimal performance. The parameters and their effects are as follows:

- K(z): Affects the controller for z. Value used = 13.
- K(phi): Affects the controller for φ. Value used = 180.
- K(theta): Affects the controller for θ. Value used = 150.
- K(psi): Affects the controller for ψ. Value used = 25.

## Performance Metrics

After testing in Gazebo, the quadrotor successfully followed the desired trajectory. The rotor velocities were well within the desired limit.

## Usage

To run the code, initialize the ROS node and run the simulation in Gazebo.

```
rosrun project your_script.py
```

For visualization, use the following command:

```
rosrun project visualize.py
```
